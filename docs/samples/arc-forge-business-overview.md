## Key Differentiators

1. **Business Context Layer**: Unlike Xero's JAX (which only knows your numbers), Pip knows your business plans, KPIs, and strategy. This enables answering questions like "Can I afford to hire?" that require both financial data AND business context.

2. **Platform Agnostic**: Future-proofed to work across Xero, MYOB, QuickBooks - switch accounting software without losing your AI assistant's history.

3. **Open Source**: Built on open source stack, portable, no vendor lock-in.

## Target Market

**Primary Avatar**: Small business owner managing own books
- 0-5 employees
- $100k-$500k annual revenue
- Using Xero, doing books themselves
- Core pain: "I didn't start this business to do bookkeeping"
- Spends 3-5 hours/week on books (resents every minute)
- Can't justify bookkeeper cost ($400-800/month) yet

## Competition

| Competitor | What They Do | Our Advantage |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| JAX (Xero) | Native AI, knows your numbers | Doesn't know your business context |
| XBert | Error detection for accountants | Different target (we're B2C) |
| ChatGPT+Zapier | DIY integration | Complex setup, we're turnkey |

## Validation Approach

1. **Demo with brother** (dental practice owner) - Thursday next week
2. **Limited beta** - Max 25 connections, manual approval
3. **Community posts** - After working demo validated
4. **Distribution expansion** - GPT Store + MCP server research

## Working Brand Name: "Pip"

**Why Pip**:
- Approachable, friendly, non-threatening
- Pippin (LOTR) vibes - loyal, curious, learns as you go
- Easy: "I'll ask Pip about my cash flow"
- Domain secured: askpip.au

**Note**: Final name pending market testing at Thursday demo.
