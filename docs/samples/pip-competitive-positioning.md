# Pip Competitive Positioning

## The Gap We Fill

**The Problem**:
- Native AI (like Xero's JAX) knows your numbers but not your business
- Generic AI (like ChatGPT) can know your business but not your live numbers
- Neither helps you make decisions that require BOTH

**Our Solution**:
Pip bridges the gap by combining:
1. Live accounting data from Xero
2. Business context (your plans, KPIs, strategy, goals)

This enables answering questions that require both:
- "Can I afford to hire someone this quarter?" (needs numbers + hiring budget from business plan)
- "Am I on track for my growth goals?" (needs numbers + KPIs)
- "What should I prioritize paying?" (needs cash flow + business priorities)

## Competitive Matrix

| Feature | JAX (Xero) | XBert | ChatGPT+Zapier | Pip |
|---------|------------|-------|----------------|-----|
| Live accounting data | Yes | Yes | Complex setup | Yes |
| Business context awareness | No | No | Manual, not persistent | Yes |
| Conversational Q&A | Yes | No | Limited | Yes |
| Multi-platform support | Xero only | Multiple | Per-platform | Xero (MYOB/QB planned) |
| Target user | SMB/Accountant | Accountant | Technical users | SMB Owner |
| Setup complexity | Low | Medium | High | Low |

## Competitor Analysis

### JAX (Xero's Native AI)
- **What it does**: Invoice generation, bank reconciliation, payment prediction
- **Weakness**: Only knows what's in Xero - no business context
- **Our angle**: "JAX knows your numbers. It doesn't know your business."

### XBert
- **What it does**: Risk detection and error alerts for bookkeepers
- **Weakness**: B2B to accountants, not business owners; no Q&A
- **Our angle**: Different target market (we're B2C to owners)

### ChatGPT + Zapier/Pipedream
- **What it does**: DIY integration between AI and Xero
- **Weakness**: Requires technical setup, expensive (multiple subscriptions), no persistent context
- **Our angle**: "You could wire it together with 3 tools. Or just use us."

## Unique Value Proposition

### Short Version
"Your AI knows your business, not just your books"

### Marketing Hooks (Customer Language)
- "Ask questions a regular chatbot can't answer"
- "Switch accounting software without losing your assistant"
- "You own your data and your AI's memory"

### What NOT to Say (Too Technical)
- "Open source self-hosted infrastructure"
- "LLM-agnostic platform"
- "MCP server architecture"

## Future Differentiation: Platform Lock-in

**The Problem with Native AI**:
> "What happens when you cancel your Xero subscription? Your AI assistant dies with it."

**Our Future Vision**:
- **Platform agnostic**: Switch from Xero to MYOB? Your assistant adapts.
- **Portable**: Take your AI's history and docs with you.
- **Open source**: If we disappear, any developer can continue.
- **Modular**: Add integrations without rebuilding everything.

## Key Insight

Every accounting software will build their own chat AI. But they all have the same blind spot: **they only know what's in their system.**

We're the layer that sits above, connecting your business brain (context, plans, strategy) to your accounting systems (numbers, cash flow, transactions).
